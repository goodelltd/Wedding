          <span>Vicki's point of view:</span>
          <p>The story of Tyler and Vicki finding each other is as timeless as
            Romeo and Juliet or Ben and Jerry. Tyler was living life in the fast
            lane Midland, TX style as a geophysicist for Crownquest, and Vicki was
            spending her days as a nurse taking care of St. George’s finest and
            sickest residents at the local hospital. Their stars would align Labor
            Day Weekend when Tyler had flown into town to visit Vicki’s cousins,
            Kim and Tom Lund. <br>
            Kim and Tom knew that both Vicki and Tyler were single, attractive,
            and their height to weight ratio seemed complimentary, so they
            immediately schemed to get them together for a game night.<br>
            Vicki mistook Tyler’s rugged good looks for those of an astronaut, and
            Tyler was mesmerized by Vicki’s spray tan and flowing blonde hair
            (blondes are the big leagues), so without further ado, the two started
            a long-distance relationship that blossomed into the website you are
            visiting today. They are so excited and grateful to be together at
            last!

          <span>Tyler's point of view:</span>
          <p>I was just visiting my close friends, Kim and TJ, when Kim brought up that
            she had a cousin who was single. She then showed me a picture of
            her and I said, "She's pretty hot and, well, Midland isn't too far away... Plus blondes are
            the big leagues." Then, fearing a long-distance relationship, I had second
            thoughts.<br>The night before I was about to leave St. George, I spent the night
            playing cards with Vicki and her family, and she didn't mind that I was cheating.
            I thought, "This girl is pretty chill. I would totally date her if she didn't
            live a billion miles away." I then left town not thinking too much more about it.
            After a lot of effort by Kim and TJ to bring us
            together, Vicki emailed me. This eventually turned into text messages,
            which eventually became phone calls, and then video calls. After a few months
            of digital communication, we finally met up again on Thanksgiving and
            immediately hit if off. That Thanksgiving weekend is when I figured out
            that I was going to marry Vicki. And so here we are.
